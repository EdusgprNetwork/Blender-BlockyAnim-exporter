This script is made for Armatures specifically, so Ensure that your Active selected object is the Armature you want to export the animation for

Then simply run the script with the Text Editor "Run Script" Button. and it will export the animation as "export.blockyanim" in the same folder as your .blend file

# Hytale Rig Blend File not included
If you want help with an animation getting exported, you can find me in the Hytale Discord in the Community-fan-art post "Blender to blockyanim"
good luck
