# How to use

Only works in blender 5.0

The python script needs to be run in Blender's Text Editor

Simply Import the Export blockyanim.py file

This script is made for Armatures specifically, so Ensure that your Active selected object is the Armature you want to export the animation for

Then simply run the script with the Text Editor "Run Script" Button. and it will export the animation as "export.blockyanim" in the same folder as your .blend file

# Disclaimer

If it doesn't export correctly, try baking your animation in pose mode using Pose > Animation > Bake Action

Then make sure to use these settings

Then click OK, and hopefully the animation will be closer to the original when exporting.
